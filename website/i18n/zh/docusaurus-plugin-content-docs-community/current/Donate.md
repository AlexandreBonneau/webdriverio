## 支出政策

我们希望以透明的方式接受集体的开支。 每个人都有资格参与开发某些特性并为其支付费用。 我们还希望能够允许我们支出活动费用于回馈社区。 以下费用类型可能有资格从集体捐款中报销：

### 活动费用

如果您举办了一场活动，并有演讲者讨论使用WebdriverIO及其特性，把么你可以报销最多__$100__。 活动费用的报销要求包括：

- 您或者活动账户必须至少在三个社交媒体（推特，脸书或领英）上分享该项目
- 活动主页必须包含WebdriverIO的logo，且在您的会议描述中有指向活动页面的链接
- 您必须将资金用于特定活动费用，比如食物，饮料，房间或设备租金。
- 您必须提交收据和您的报销请求。

### 开发支出

If you have done development work on any of the repositories within the GitHub WebdriverIO organisation you may reimburse up to __$1000__ if the following requirements are met:

- You must have submitted qualifying pull requests that have closed at least 10 issues that were labeled with [`Expensable 💸`](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/labels/Expensable%20%F0%9F%92%B8)
- Every additional issue closed with that label can be expensed with $100
- You must submit links to all issues you’ve closed due to your pull requests
- In order to close the ticket automatically, you must have one commit message with the Fix keyword. For example, Fix #1234 to close ticket #1234.
- Pull Requests must be merged by someone from the [core team](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/main/AUTHORS.md#tsc-technical-steering-committee). If there are several Pull Requests, the core team member either selects the most recent one or the best one - that’s up to them to decide what is best for the project.
- You must claim an [`Expensable 💸`](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/labels/Expensable%20%F0%9F%92%B8) issue by commenting to the issue thread to ensure that no one else is working on the same issue.
- Anyone contributing to WebdriverIO is eligible to expense their work if the implemented features or bug fixes are not objectives of a commercial job.

### Travel Expenses

If you are a member of the [Technical Steering Committee team](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/main/AUTHORS.md#tsc-technical-steering-committee) you are eligible to expense flights and hotel accommodations for travel to conferences or meetups as part of a speaking engagement on WebdriverIO, not paid by the event itself or a company. You may expense up to $500. Reimbursement requirements for travel expenses include:

- You must send out a post from your main social media account (e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn or personal blog) thanking all contributors of the collective after the event took place.
- You must use the funds for qualified travel expenses such as ground or air transportation to the event and hotel accomodations.
- You must submit receipts with your reimbursement request.
